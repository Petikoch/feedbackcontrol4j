== The release process

* Check everything (code, docs, ...) is fine in the repo and ready to release
* Write the release notes in `next_releasenotes_draft.md`
* Set the version in `build.gradle`
* Commit and push
* run gradle task `uploadArchives`
* Check the newly created staging repo in https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories
** are the artifacts ok?
** is the pom correct?
** If not, drop the staging repo, fix whatever needs a fix and try again
** Do `close` the staging respository (takes a couple of seconds, this will check the artifacts)
** Do `release` the staging respository
** After 10 - 15 minutes the new artifacts should be available on Maven Central
* Create manually on Github a new release under "releases"
** use the same version for the git tag as the version in `build.gradle`
** use the text from `next_releasenotes_draft.md` for the release description
* Set the version in `build.gradle` to the next SNAPSHOT version
* Clear `next_releasenotes_draft.md`
* Commit and push
