== Introduction

*feedbackcontrol4j* is a small, standalone java library.

Implement feedback control in your applications.Main entities are Controller, Controllable, Sensor, Filter, ControlLoop, ...

For further reading I can recommend
http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028970.do[*Feeback Control for computer Systems*] from Philipp K. Janert.

=== Examples

See link:src/test/java/ch/petikoch/libs/feedbackcontrol4j/control[executable documentation in src/test/java] for examples.

=== Use cases

* "self adaptive" behaviour of your application instead of "classic", manual configuration
** number of workers / threads / vm's / ...
** size of cache
** number of database connections
** number of "hot spares"
* implementing "flow control" between producer and consumer
* manage CPU load
* ...

== Requirements

To use this library you need

* Java 8 or later

== Installation

=== Usage in Gradle, Maven, ...

==== Gradle based build

Add the following dependency in your gradle build file:

[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
   mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'ch.petikoch.libs:feedbackcontrol4j:x.y.z' // replace x.y.z with the real version

    // or "latest" release, for the braves:
    //compile 'ch.petikoch.libs:feedbackcontrol4j:+'
}
----

==== Maven based build

Add jtwfg as dependency to your pom.xml:

[source,xml]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>ch.petikoch.libs</groupId>
            <artifactId>feedbackcontrol4j</artifactId>
            <version>x.y.z</version> <!-- replace x.y.z with the real version -->
            <!-- or latest release, for the braves
            <version>RELEASE</version>
            -->
        </dependency>

== Release notes

See https://github.com/Petikoch/feedbackcontrol4j/releases.

== Support

Please use GitHub issues and pull requests for support.

== How to build the project

To run a build of the feedbackcontrol4j project on your machine, clone the git repo to your local machine and start the gradle based build using the gradle wrapper from the shell/command line:

[source]
----
> ./gradlew build
----

== Motivation

Feedback control is IMHO in "enterprise" software development still pretty new (2015), but very promising.

I didn't find any "ready-to-go" library for the JVM to implement custom feedback control closed loops,
so I started with this work here.
