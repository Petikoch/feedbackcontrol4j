== Introduction

*feedbackcontrol4j* is a small, standalone java library.

Implement feedback control in your applications. Main entities are Controller, Controllable, Sensor, Filter, ControlLoop, ...

For further reading I can recommend
http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028970.do[*Feeback Control for computer Systems*] from Philipp K. Janert.

=== Examples

See link:src/test/groovy/ch/petikoch/libs/feedbackcontrol4j/control[executable documentation in src/test/groovy] for examples.

=== Use cases

* "self adaptive" behaviour of your application instead of "classic", manual configuration
** number of workers / threads / vm's / ...
** size of cache
** number of database connections
** number of "hot spares"
* implementing "flow control" between producer and consumer
* manage CPU load
* ...

== Requirements

To use this library you need

* Java 7 or later for feedbackcontrol4j versions 1.x and 2.x
* Java 8 or later for feedbackcontrol4j version >= 3.x

== Installation

=== Usage in Gradle, Maven, ...

==== Gradle based build

Add the following dependency in your gradle build file:

[source,groovy]
----
repositories {
   jcenter() // Bintray's JCenter repository
}

dependencies {
    compile 'ch.petikoch.libs:feedbackcontrol4j:x.y.z'

    // or "latest" release, for the braves:
    //compile 'ch.petikoch.libs:feedbackcontrol4j:+'
}
----

==== Maven based build

Add jtwfg as dependency to your pom.xml:

[source,xml]
----
        <dependency>
            <groupId>ch.petikoch.libs</groupId>
            <artifactId>feedbackcontrol4j</artifactId>
            <version>x.y.z</version>
            <!-- or latest release, for the braves
            <version>RELEASE</version>
            -->
        </dependency>
----

Be sure to have Bintray's JCenter repository in your maven settings.xml. If not, see "Set me up!" on the
https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter page for instructions to set it up.

==== Just the jar

== Release notes

See https://github.com/Petikoch/feedbackcontrol4j/releases.

== Support

Please use GitHub issues and pull requests for support.

== How to build the project

To run a build of the feedbackcontrol4j project on your machine, clone the git repo to your local machine and start the gradle based build using
gradle's http://gradleware.com/registered-access?content=screencasts%2Fthe-gradle-wrapper%2F[gradlewrapper] from the shell/command line:

[source]
----
> ./gradlew build
----


== Motivation

Feedback control is IMO in "enterprise" software development still pretty new (2015), but very promising.

I didn't find any "ready-to-go" library for the JVM to implement custom feedback control closed loops,
so I started with this work here.
